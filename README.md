# Tensorflow 1.3 & TFLearn
- The aim of this project is to learn basis of Tensorflow and TFLearn 
- Creating simple object detection model training examples using Tensorflow 1.3 (CPU version since GPU one is no longer supported on OSX) 
- Repo will contain separate directories for each sub-project
- Each project will be in Jupyter Notebook

#### MNIST 
When it comes to object detection MNIST DB is absolute must do, so that is going to be my first choice
