# Tensorflow 1.3 & TFLearn
- The aim of this project is to learn basis of Tensorflow and TFLearn 
- Creating simple object detection model training examples using Tensorflow 1.3 (CPU version since GPU one is no longer supported on OSX) 
- Repo will contain separate directories for each sub-project
- Each project will be in Jupyter Notebook

----------
#### MNIST 
When it comes to object detection MNIST DB is absolute must do, so that is going to be my first choice

----------
#### Cats vs. Dogs
- The idea came from Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition
- Data I used in the project come from kaggle(see link above)
